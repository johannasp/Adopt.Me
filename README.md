# Adopt.Me

Welcome to Adopt.me. It's Tinder, but for Dogs ðŸ˜„!

...

### Wait...
#### no...

We're not facilitating hook ups for Dogs.
Nor are we trying to start a Dog dating service.

If that's where your mind went...I don't blame you I kinda set us up for that one.

However, we are making it easier and fun to start life-long meaningful relationships with a pet that needs a home.

Created at Cornell University's Animal Health Hackathon our team, Team Bear-ly Trying (we really like puns, do not let this
act as an indicator of our willingness to put in effort), saw a need in a rather basic but very much neccessary service, adoption.

Adoption from a shelter should always be the number one option when looking to bring a pet into the home. But the process can be long
and daunting, discouraging many potential adopters from doing just that. So we took the analogy of human relationships and applied
it to this problem. Looking for a girlfriend/boyfriend was a pretty daunting task in itself, but Tinder has made that process
much less awkward, much shorter, and generally more successful. So our Software Engineers utilized what they learned in CUAppDev's Intro
to iOS App Development course last semester (Fall '16) to design the app basing it mainly from Tinder's UI. The app will take pictures and info
of dogs (soon cats, hamsters, whatever a shelter may be offering) from the website of shelters and then users can swipe right
to show interest or swipe left to ignore the animal. Showing interest provides you with contact information of the shelter so that
you may get into contact with them and schedule a session to meet with the potential future pet.

We have a lot more ideas for adding to the app in the pipeline but for now, this is Adopt.me.


We're just 3 Cornell students who started a Robotics team in high-school together.

But when we see a problem in the world, we use what we have to fix it.

And in our case that's iOS app developing skills.

Happy swiping.
